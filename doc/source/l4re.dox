/**
 * \example hello/server/src/main.c
 * This is the famous "Hello World!" program.
 *
 * \example examples/sys/ipc/ipc_example.c
 * This example shows how two threads can exchange data using the L4 IPC
 * mechanism. One thread is sending an integer to the other thread which
 * is returning the square of the integer. Both values are printed.
 *
 * \example examples/sys/ipc/ipc.cfg
 * Sample configuration file for the IPC example.
 *
 * \example examples/sys/start-with-exc/main.c
 * This example shows how to start a newly created thread with a defined set
 * of CPU registers.
 *
 * \example examples/sys/singlestep/main.c
 * This example shows how a thread can be single stepped on the x86
 * architecture.
 *
 * \example examples/sys/aliens/main.c
 * This example shows how system call tracing can be done.
 *
 * \example examples/sys/utcb-ipc/main.c
 * This example shows how to send IPC using the UTCB to store payload.
 *
 * \example examples/sys/isr/main.c
 * Example of an interrupt service routine.
 *
 * \example examples/clntsrv/src/server.cc
 * Client/Server example using C++ infrastructure -- Server implementation.
 * \example examples/clntsrv/src/client.cc
 * Client/Server example using C++ infrastructure -- Client implementation.
 * \example examples/clntsrv/src/shared.h
 * Client/Server example using C++ infrastructure -- Shared header file.
 * \example examples/clntsrv/configs/clntsrv.cfg
 * Sample configuration file for the client/server example.
 *
 * \example examples/libs/l4re/c/ma+rm.c
 * Coarse grained memory allocation, in C.
 * \example examples/libs/l4re/c++/mem_alloc/ma+rm.cc
 * Coarse grained memory allocation, in C++.
 *
 * \example examples/libs/l4re/c++/shared_ds/ds_clnt.cc
 * Sharing memory between applications, client side.
 * \example examples/libs/l4re/c++/shared_ds/ds_srv.cc
 * Sharing memory between applications, server/creator side.
 * \example examples/libs/l4re/c++/shared_ds/shared_ds.cfg
 * Sharing memory between applications, configuration file.
 *
 * \example examples/libs/l4re/streammap/server.cc
 * Client/Server example showing how to map a page to another task -- Server
 * implementation. Note that there's also a shared memory library that
 * supplies this functionality in more convenient way.
 * \example examples/libs/l4re/streammap/client.cc
 * Client/Server example showing how to map a page to another task -- Client
 * implementation. Note that there's also a shared memory library that
 * supplies this functionality in more convenient way.
 * \example examples/libs/l4re/streammap/streammap.cfg
 * Sample configuration file for the client/server map example.
 *
 *
 * \example examples/libs/libirq/loop.c
 * libirq usage example using a self-created thread.
 *
 * \example examples/libs/libirq/async_isr.c
 * libirq usage example using asynchronous ISR handler functionality.
 *
 * \example examples/sys/migrate/thread_migrate.cc
 * Thread migration example.
 *
 * \example examples/sys/migrate/thread_migrate.cfg
 * Sample configuration file for the thread migration example.
 *
 * \example tmpfs/lib/src/fs.cc
 * Example file system for L4Re::Vfs.
